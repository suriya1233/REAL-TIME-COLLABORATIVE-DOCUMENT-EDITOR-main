# DESCRIPTION :
A Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a full-stack web application that enables multiple users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents simultaneously. It features real-time text synchronization, allowing instant updates across all connected users using WebSockets (Socket.io) or Firebase Realtime Database. The editor includes rich-text formatting, commenting, and chat functionality, making it ideal for team collaboration. User authentication with JWT, OAuth, or Firebase Auth ensures secure access, while role-based permissions allow different levels of control, such as viewing or editing documents. A version history system tracks changes, enabling users to restore previous versions if needed. Documents are autosaved in a cloud database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase Firestore, ensuring accessibility from any device. For storage, services like Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Firebase Storage handle document uploads. The frontend is built with React.js or Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS or Material UI, while the backend runs on Node.js with Express.js (or Django/Flask for Python-based development). The application is deployed on Vercel/Netlify for the frontend and Heroku/Railway for the backend, offering a seamless and scalable experience. This project provides hands-on experience in real-time collaboration, WebSocket communication, backend API development, and cloud storage integration, making it an excellent challenge for full-stack developers.
